My curriculum is also a bootloader
====================================

![ScreenShot](demo.gif)

What?
------------

The PDF attached in this repository is both a working PDF of my CV and a custom bootloader created by me to impress technical recruiters. [Check the discussion in HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19344146).

How?
------------

I wrote a tiny bootloader of 1018 bytes. Then I just copy the first bytes of my bootloader at the beginning of my CV and that is it, a working PDF and bootloader.

Can I try it?
------------

Sure! You can do so by two means, in real hardware (I spend a lot of time making it compatible) or in an emulated environment.

#### Real hardware

**NOTE:** All the data on the USB will be lost, please make sure you have a backup before continuing.

##### Windows

You can use [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) and use the PDF as the input image.

To recover your USB just right click on it and format normally.

##### Linux
**NOTE:** Please be very careful with this command. If you select the wrong drive **you will lose data**.

Get a USB, check the device name (you can use df -h) and do:
```bash
sudo dd if=pablo_jimenez_mateo_cv.pdf of=/dev/sdX bs=512 count=2880
sync
```

where X is your device.

To recover your USB just use [gparted](https://gparted.org/).

#### Emulated environment

##### Qemu
```bash
qemu-system-i386 -drive format=raw,file=pablo_jimenez_mateo_cv.pdf
```

##### Bochs:

Create a bochsrc.txt file with this contents:
```text
megs: 32
romimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/BIOS-bochs-latest, address=0xfffe0000
vgaromimage: file=/usr/share/bochs/VGABIOS-lgpl-latest
floppya: 1_44=pablo_jimenez_mateo_cv.pdf, status=inserted
boot: a
log: bochsout.txt
mouse: enabled=0
display_library: x, options="gui_debug"
```

And then execute bochs as follows:

```bash
bochs -f bochsrc.txt
```

Compiling from source
------------

```bash
nasm boot.asm -o boot.bin
```

Get your vanilla PDF, CV_english.pdf in this example, and do:
```bash
qpdf --stream-data=uncompress --object-streams=disable CV_english.pdf uncompressed.pdf
python3 patch.py
```

FAQ
------------

* But why?

    As a learning experience. I realized that I had no practical knowledge on how the booting process works, and also my assembly was a little bit rusty. This is a project I really enjoyed, although it was a little bit overwhelming at some points.

* Can you explain how?

    I have tried my best to comment the code thoroughly, including my optimization decisions as well as the encoding of the sprites. I have also linked to a couple of Stackoverflow answers for deeper understanding.

* But now your PDF is bigger!

    Yes, but 1018 bytes bigger or less than 0.01% bigger. For comparison, the gif in this readme is 2778093 bytes or 2728,97 times bigger! The Firefox icon is 8532 bytes, 8.38 times bigger!
